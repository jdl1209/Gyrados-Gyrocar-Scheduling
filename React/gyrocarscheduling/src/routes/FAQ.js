                Q: What do I need to sign up for GyroGoGo?
                A:  All you need to do is provide some basic information on yourself plus your driver's license information and a valid credit card. You will receive your approval within 24-72 hours.
                Q: You declined my application for membership. What can I do about this?
                A: When your application was declined, you were provided a reason for the decision. You need to rectify this problem. Most commonly this is because either a license or a credit card has expired. If you provide us with current credentials, we are happy to move your membership forward.
                Q: What is the process for renting a gyrocar?
                A: Your first step is to apply for a membership in GyroGoGo on this website. You will have access to our rental functions as soon as your information has been verified. The step-by-step reservation process is clear and easy to use; just select your desired pick up and drop off locations and start/return dates and times. You'll receive a confirmation email with pick up instructions and the necessary access code for your vehicle.
                Q: Do I need a special kind of license to drive a gyrocar?
                A: No. A current, regular driver's license is all that is required to legally drive a gyrocar.
                Q: I have never ridden a motorcycle. How will I be able to safely drive a gyrocar?
                A: A gyrocar uses a gyroscope for balance, so you do not need to learn the kind of skills required for riding a motorcycle. Driving a gyrocar is much like driving your automobile, just more slender and more nimble.
                Q: How far in advance can I make reservations for a GyroGoGo car?
                A: Reservations are allowed up to one month in advance.
                Q: I regularly commute to the county courthouse. Can I make reservations for several trips at the same time?
                A: Yes, a member may have more than one reservation booked at a time.
                Q: Do I have to return the gyrocar to the same location I picked it up from?
                A: No, you are not required to return the vehicle to the same location. During the rental process you will be asked the return destination.
                Q: Is there any limit to the distance from the pick up site I can drive the gyrocar?
                A: Yes, our vehicles are geo-fenced to operate no more than 20 miles outside Monroe County. The car will shut off if you exceed this perimeter.
                Q: Is there a limit to the number of hours or days I can rent the gyrocar?
                A: You can rent a GyroGoGo car for the time duration that meets you needs up to one month. If you wish to reserve the car for longer, you will need to make sequential reservations.
                Q: Can I change the date after I've made a reservation?
                A: Yes. You always have the ability to view and edit a reservation when signed into your account.
                Q: Can I recharge the gyrocar at and EV recharge station?
                A: Yes, the gyrocars can be charged at any standard EV station. However, other vehicles cannot access the GyroGoGo chargers; the chargers have a deterrent feature that prevent such use.
                Q: What do I do if there is a mechanical problem during my rental?
                A: Just call our 800 Customer Service number and we will promptly send a mechanic with a replacement vehicle to assist you.

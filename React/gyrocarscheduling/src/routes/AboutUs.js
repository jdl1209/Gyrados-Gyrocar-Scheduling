            <h1>About Us</h1>

            <p>We invite you to join us in using GyroGoGo for easy, convenient personal transportation. Rent a gyrocar for a single run into downtown, or rent it for the day to visit multiple destinations. The cars are designed to carry a single passenger and a small amount of cargo.
                Gyrocars are easy to drive because internal gyroscopes balance the cars for you. You don't need any special training to drive a gyrocar, just slide in and go! These cars have a small profile, so are easy to navigate through traffic - and parking is a breeze. County regulations even allow gyrocars to be parked in designated motorcycle slots.
                We have five convenient pick up/drop off locations in Monroe County, including in center city. Your rental is operated with a unique access code that prevents anyone else from entering your vehicle. If you've opted for a longer rental, our gyrocars can be recharged at any EV charging station.
                If you need more information, check out the Q&A section or send us a message through our Contact Page.
            </p>
